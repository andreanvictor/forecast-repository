    <h1>About the Zoltar Forecast Archive</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Zoltar forecast archive, a website developed by <a href="http://reichlab.io/">the Reich Lab</a>
        in the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/sphhs/biostatistics" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics and
            Epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> to create an archive of model forecast results
        along with tools to compare, etc.
    </p>

    <p>Zoltar is a web application to develop ideas for a repository of model forecast results. Until now, predictions made by
        models have been stored in differing formats and locations. This complicates tracking, comparing, and revisiting
        forecasts. Zoltar supports storing, retrieving, comparing, and analyzing time series forecasts for prediction challenges
        of interest to the modeling community.

    <p>Please visit the <a href="https://docs.zoltardata.com/">Zoltar Documentation Site</a> for more information, along
        with guides for users, researchers, and developers (including R and Python libraries for accessing the Zoltar
        API).
